    The credentials_factory.py module is now marked as stable for Tempest
    plugins. It provides helpers that can be used by Tempest plugins to
    obtain test credentials for their test cases in a format that honors the
    Tempest configuration in use.
    Credentials may be provisioned on the fly during the test run, or they
    can be setup in advance and fed to test via a YAML file; they can be
    setup for identity v2 or identity v3.
