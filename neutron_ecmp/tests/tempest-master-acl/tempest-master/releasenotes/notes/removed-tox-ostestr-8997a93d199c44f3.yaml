    The tox ostestr job (normally invoked with ``tox -eostestr``) has been
    removed. This was lightly used, and in the near future ostestr will be
    removed from the tempest requirements file. If you were relying on this
    functionality you can replicate it by using the venv-tempest tox job. For
    example, simply running ``tox -evenv-tempest -- ostestr`` will do the same
    thing the old ostestr job did.
