    When registering service clients from installed plugins, all registrations
    are now processed, even if one or more fails. All exceptions encountered
    during the registration process are recorded.  If at least one exception
    was encountered, the registration process fails and all interim errors are
    reported.

    The __repr__ method is now implemented for the base `tempest.Exception`
    class, its implementation is identical to __str__: it reports the error
    message merged with input parameters.
