    Pause teardown
    When pause_teardown flag in tempest.conf is set to True a pdb breakpoint
    is added to tearDown and tearDownClass methods in test.py.
    This allows to pause cleaning resources process, so that used resources
    can be examined. Closer examination of used resources may lead to faster
    debugging.
