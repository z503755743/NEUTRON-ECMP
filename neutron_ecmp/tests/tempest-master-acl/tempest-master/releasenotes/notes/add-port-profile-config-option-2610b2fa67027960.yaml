features:
  - A new config option 'port_profile' is added to the section
    'network' to specify capabilities of the port.
    By default this is set to {}. When using OVS HW offload
    feature we need to create Neutron port with a certain
    capability. This is done by creating Neutron port with
    binding profile. To be able to test this we need profile
    capability support in Tempest as well.
