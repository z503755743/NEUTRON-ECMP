    Replace any call in your code to credentials_factory.DEFAULT_PARAMS with
    a call to config.service_client_config().
fixes:
  - |
    The credentials_factory module used to load configuration at import time
    which caused configuration being loaded at test discovery time.
    This was fixed by removing the DEFAULT_PARAMS variable. This variable
    was redundant (and outdated), the same dictionary (but up to date) can
    be obtained via invoking config.service_client_config() with no service
    parameter.
