features:
  - |
    Adds volume service clients for v3 APIs. As v3 base API should be
    identical to v2 APIs, we just copy all existing v2 service client
    for v3 API.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecates the volume service clients for v2 APIs. Volume v2 APIs
    are deprecated in all supported stable branches, so it's time
    to deprecate the tempest service clients for v2 APIs and remove in future
    release.
