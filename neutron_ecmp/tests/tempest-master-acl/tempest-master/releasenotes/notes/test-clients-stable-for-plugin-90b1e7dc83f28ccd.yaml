    Two extra modules are now marked as stable for plugins, test.py and clients.py.
    The former includes the test base class with its automatic credentials
    provisioning and test resource managing fixtures.
    The latter is built on top of ServiceClients and it adds aliases and a few custom
    configurations to it.
