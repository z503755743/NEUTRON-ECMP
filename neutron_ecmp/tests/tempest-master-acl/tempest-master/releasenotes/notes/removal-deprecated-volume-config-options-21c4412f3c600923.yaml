    Below config option was deprecated for removal since juno release.
    It's time to remove it as all supported stable branches and Tempest plugins
    are good to handle it.

    * ``[volume_feature_enabled].api_v1``

    Also Tempest removes the below corresponding service clients alias from
    client.py which were being set based on above removed config option.

    * self.backups_client
    * self.encryption_types_client
    * self.snapshots_client
    * self.volume_availability_zone_client
    * self.volume_hosts_client
    * self.volume_limits_client
    * self.volume_qos_client
    * self.volume_quotas_client
    * self.volume_services_client
    * self.volume_types_client
    * self.volumes_client
    * self.volumes_extension_client
