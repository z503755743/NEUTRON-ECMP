upgrade:
  - |
    The volume config option ``catalog_type`` default is changed to
    ``volumev3`` which is v3 API endpoint configured in devstack.
    With this change Tempest will be testing v3 API as default.
    User who want to test v2 API can still test by configuring the
    ``catalog_type`` to v2 endpoint.
