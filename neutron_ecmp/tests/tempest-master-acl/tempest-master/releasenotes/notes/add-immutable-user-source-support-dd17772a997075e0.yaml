    Add a new config setting ``immutable_user_source`` in the
    ``[identity-feature-enabled]`` group that defaults to false.
    This setting, combined with the usage of the ``@testtools.skipIf()``
    decorator, will allow tests that require user creation, deletion,
    or modification to skip instead of failing in environments that
    are LDAP-backed. In such environments, the user source is read-only,
    so this feature flag is needed to allow such tests to gracefully skip
    without having to blacklist them.
