features:
- The Tempest CLI commands have switched from calling testrepository internally
  to use stestr instead. This means that all of the features and bug fixes from
  moving to stestr are available to the tempest commands.

upgrade:
- Tempest CLI commands will no long rely on anything from testr. This means any
  data in existing testr internals that were being exposed are no longer
  present. For example things like the .testr directories will be silently
  ignored. There is a potential incompatibility for existing users who are
  relying on test results being stored by testr. Anything relying on previous
  testr behavior will need to be updated to handle stestr.
