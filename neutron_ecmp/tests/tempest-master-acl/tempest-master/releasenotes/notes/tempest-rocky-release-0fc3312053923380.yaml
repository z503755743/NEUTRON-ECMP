    This release is to tag the Tempest for OpenStack Rocky release.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

      * Rocky
      * Queens
      * Pike
      * Ocata

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack Stein development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the Stein cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a Stein (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Rocky release.
