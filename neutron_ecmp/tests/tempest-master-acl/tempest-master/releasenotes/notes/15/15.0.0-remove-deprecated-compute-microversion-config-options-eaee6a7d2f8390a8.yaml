upgrade:
  - The deprecated compute microversion config options from
    'compute-feature-enabled' group have been removed. Those config options
    are available under 'compute' group to configure the min and max
    microversion for compute service.

    * CONF.compute.min_microversion
    * CONF.compute.max_microversion
