    [`blueprint application-credentials <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/application-credentials>`_]
    Tempest can test keystone's application credentials interface. A new client
    library is added for application credentials, and a new config option,
    ``[identity-feature-enabled]/application_credentials``, can control whether
    the application credentials feature is tested (defaults to False,
    indicating the feature is not enabled in the cloud under test).
