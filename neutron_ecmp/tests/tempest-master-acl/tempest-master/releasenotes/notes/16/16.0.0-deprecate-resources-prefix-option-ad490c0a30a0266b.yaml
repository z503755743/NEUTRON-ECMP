upgrade:
  - The default value of rand_name()'s prefix argument is changed
    to 'tempest' from None to identify resources are created by
    Tempest.
deprecations:
  - The resources_prefix is marked as deprecated because it is
    enough to set 'tempest' as the prefix on rand_name() to
    identify resources which are created by Tempest and no
    projects set this option on OpenStack dev community.
