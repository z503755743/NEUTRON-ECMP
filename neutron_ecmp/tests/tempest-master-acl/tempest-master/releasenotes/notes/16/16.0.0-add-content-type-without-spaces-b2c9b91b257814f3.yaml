upgrade:
  - The ``JSON_ENC`` and ``TXT_ENC`` option in the ``_error_checker``
    section have been added with additional content-type which are
    defined in RFC7231 but missing in the current rest_client.py file.
    The lack of these additional content-type will cause defcore test
    to fail for OpenStack public cloud which uses tomcat module in the
    api gateway. The additions are ``application/json;charset=utf-8``,
    ``text/html;charset=utf-8``, ``text/plain;charset=utf-8``
