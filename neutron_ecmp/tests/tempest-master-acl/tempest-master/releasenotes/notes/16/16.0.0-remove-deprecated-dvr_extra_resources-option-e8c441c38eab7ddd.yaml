  - |
    The deprecated config option 'dvr_extra_resources' from network group has been removed.
    This option was for extra resources which were provisioned to bind a router to Neutron
    L3 agent. The extra resources need to be provisioned in Liberty release or older,
    and are not required since Mitaka release. Current Tempest doesn't support Liberty, so
    this option has been removed from Tempest.
