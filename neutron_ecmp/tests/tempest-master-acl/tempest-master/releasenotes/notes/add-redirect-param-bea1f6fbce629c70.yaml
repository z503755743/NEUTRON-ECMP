features:

    A new parameter ``follow_redirects`` has been added to the class
    ``RestClient``, which is passed through to ``ClosingHttp`` or
    ``ClosingProxyHttp`` respectively. The default value is ``True``
    which corresponds to the previous behaviour of following up to five
    redirections before returning a response. Setting
    ``follow_redirects = False`` allows to disable this behaviour, so
    that any redirect that is received is directly returned to the caller.
    This allows tests to verify that an API is responding with a redirect.
