    A new configuration option ``[compute-feature-enabled]/volume_multiattach``
    has been added which defaults to False. Set this to True to enable volume
    multiattach testing. These tests require that compute API version 2.60 is
    available and block storage API version 3.44 is available.

    .. note:: In the Queens release, the only compute driver that supports
      volume multiattach is the libvirt driver, and only then when qemu<2.10
      or libvirt>=3.10. The only volume backend in Queens that supports volume
      multiattach is lvm.
