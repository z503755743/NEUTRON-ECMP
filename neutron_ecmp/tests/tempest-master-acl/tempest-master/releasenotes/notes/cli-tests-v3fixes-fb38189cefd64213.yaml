    The CLIClient class, when it calls a command line client, uses
    ``--os-project-name`` instead of ``--os-tenant-name`` for the
    project, and passes ``--os-identity-api-version`` (default empty).
    All CLI clients still available in supported releases of OpenStack
    which are wrapped by the ``cmd_with_auth()`` method support those
    switches.
