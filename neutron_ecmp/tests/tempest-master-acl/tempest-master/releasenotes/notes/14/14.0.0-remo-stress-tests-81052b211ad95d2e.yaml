  This release is marking the end of Liberty release support in Tempest
upgrade:
  - The Stress tests framework and all the stress tests have been removed.
other:

    OpenStack releases supported at this time are **Mitaka** and **Newton**.

    The release under current development as of this tag is Ocata, meaning that
    every Tempest commit is also tested against master during the Ocata cycle.
    However, this does not necessarily mean that using Tempest as of this tag
    will work against a Ocata (or future releases) cloud.
