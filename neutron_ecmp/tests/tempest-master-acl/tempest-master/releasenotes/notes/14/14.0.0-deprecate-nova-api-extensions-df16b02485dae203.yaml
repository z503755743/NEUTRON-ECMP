deprecations:
  - The *api_extensions* config option in the *compute-feature-enabled* group is
    now deprecated. This option will be removed from tempest when all the
    OpenStack releases supported by tempest no longer support the API extensions
    mechanism. This was removed from Nova during the Newton cycle, so this will
    be removed at the Mitaka EOL.
