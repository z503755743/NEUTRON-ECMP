    This release also marks the end of support for Newton in Tempest.
other:
    - OpenStack Releases supported after this release are **Queens**, **Pike**,
      and **Ocata**.

      The release under current development of this tag is Rocky, meaning
      that every Tempest commit is also tested against master during the Rocky
      cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using Tempest as of
      this tag will work against a Rocky (or future release) cloud.
