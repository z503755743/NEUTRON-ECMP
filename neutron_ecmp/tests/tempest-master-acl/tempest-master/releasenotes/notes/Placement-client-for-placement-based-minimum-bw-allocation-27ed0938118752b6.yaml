    Add basic read-only Placement client to Tempest to make possible the
    testing of the placement based bandwidth allocation feature.
    The following API calls are available for tempest from now:

    * GET /allocation_candidates
    * GET /allocations/{consumer_uuid}

    Add new config group ``placement``, with the config options:

    * ``endpoint_type`` to use for communication with placement service.
    * ``catalog_type`` of the placement service.
    * ``region`` as the placement region name to use.
    * ``min_microversion`` and ``max_microversion`` as the range between
      placement API requests are sent.
