    Add a new parameter called ``bug_type`` to
    ``tempest.lib.decorators.related_bug`` and
    ``tempest.lib.decorators.skip_because`` decorators, which accepts
    2 values:

    * launchpad
    * storyboard

    This offers the possibility of tracking bugs related to tests using
    launchpad or storyboard references. The default value is launchpad
    for backward compatibility.

    Passing in a non-digit ``bug`` value to either decorator will raise
    a ``InvalidParam`` exception (previously ``ValueError``).
