deprecations:
  - |
    The v2 volume API has been deprecated since Pike release.
    Volume v3 API is current and Tempest volume tests can
    be run against v2 or v3 API based on config option
    ``CONF.volume.catalog_type``. If catalog_type is ``volumev2``, then
    all the volume tests will run against v2 API. If catalog_type is
    ``volumev3`` which is default in Tempest, then all the volume
    tests will run against v3 API.
    That makes below config options unusable in Tempest which used to
    select the target volume API for volume tests.

    * ``CONF.volume-feature-enabled.api_v2``
    * ``CONF.volume-feature-enabled.api_v3``

    Tempest deprecate the above two config options in Rocky release
    and will be removed in future. Alternatively ``CONF.volume.catalog_type``
    can be used to run the Tempest against volume v2 or v3 API.
