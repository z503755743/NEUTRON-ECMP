Utility for cleaning up environment after Tempest test run

**Usage:** ``tempest cleanup [--help] [OPTIONS]``

If run with no arguments, ``tempest cleanup`` will query your OpenStack
deployment and build a list of resources to delete and destroy them. This list
will exclude the resources from ``saved_state.json`` and will include the
configured admin account if the ``--delete-tempest-conf-objects`` flag is
specified. By default the admin project is not deleted and the admin user
specified in ``tempest.conf`` is never deleted.

Example Run
-----------

.. warning::

    If step 1 is skipped in the example below, the cleanup procedure
    may delete resources that existed in the cloud before the test run. This
    may cause an unwanted destruction of cloud resources, so use caution with
    this command.

    Examples::

     $ tempest cleanup --init-saved-state
     $ # Actual running of Tempest tests
     $ tempest cleanup

Runtime Arguments
-----------------

* ``--init-saved-state``: Initializes the saved state of the OpenStack
  deployment and will output a ``saved_state.json`` file containing resources
  from your deployment that will be preserved from the cleanup command. This
  should be done prior to running Tempest tests.

* ``--delete-tempest-conf-objects``: If option is present, then the command
  will delete the admin project in addition to the resources associated with
  them on clean up. If option is not present, the command will delete the
  resources associated with the Tempest and alternate Tempest users and
  projects but will not delete the projects themselves.

* ``--dry-run``: Creates a report (``./dry_run.json``) of the projects that
  will be cleaned up (in the ``_projects_to_clean`` dictionary [1]_) and the
  global objects that will be removed (domains, flavors, images, roles,
  projects, and users). Once the cleanup command is executed (e.g. run without
  parameters), running it again with ``--dry-run`` should yield an empty
  report.

* ``--help``: Print the help text for the command and parameters.

.. [1] The ``_projects_to_clean`` dictionary in ``dry_run.json`` lists the
    projects that ``tempest cleanup`` will loop through to delete child
    objects, but the command will, by default, not delete the projects
    themselves. This may differ from the ``projects`` list as you can clean
    the Tempest and alternate Tempest users and projects but they will not be
    deleted unless the ``--delete-tempest-conf-objects`` flag is used to
    force their deletion.
